# photoshow
A web page to view sketches photos and add text under the photo, with an administration to add and delete. My original idea was, that, when I have some idea in my head, and I would like to put it on paper, I would of course scribble it down onto the back of the cigarette package. But then I am a somehow unorganised person, and I will gather heaps of papers slips with all kind if sketches all over the place, and then, after months, I throw them away into paper recycling container, after casting a glance on it.(aha, that was this and this idea, but now, I'm sorry  for you idea, but now  I have my desk cleaning fureure... as I feel to suffocate of all the mess) With this web page, I - at least principally- the chance, to take a photo of my sketch, and write the explanations below, and then I can store it into this webpage, and it is not lost. (Basically, there a programs for samrtphones to do that, but who knows, when I will buy a new smartphone, if I will be able to transfer the data from the old smartphone to a new one?) I would put the administration pho into a protected folder (see https://docs.gandi.net/en/web_hosting/tutorials/htaccess.html) so only authorized person can delete, add and comment sketches and photos. 
The view angle of the photo can be changed (like 0 or 90 degrees) and a subtitle can be added.
 The jpg, png etc  files are stored in the photoalbum_data folder.

Administration page:
By clicking the button  with the number "0", "1", "2"  the respective photos is deleted. (OK, this is not good, but I have not yed had the time to make this better; for the moment it's working without crashing and causing the database having errors, that was the main hting for me)
